I wrote it as a Christmas present for my mom. It is a completely offline recipe organizer. It runs as a shareable *.exe that can be emailed and self installs. The recipes are each stored in a separate file so they can be organized how you like. This program is free to use.<br /><div><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/jandjsoftwaredevelopment/reciplease/downloads">Download</a></div>
