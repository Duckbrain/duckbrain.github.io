My most popular Chrome extension, LDS Scriptures, has been moved. You can still <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lds-scriptures/ijknidpjhcgbeliijjdmlonlcaobfldf">download the 2.3 version from the Chrome Web Store</a>, but the newest Alpha and any future updates will be on <a href="https://github.com/Duckbrain/lds-scriptures">GitHub</a>. You should have no issues running both side by side, except for when Chrome ends the API's used in version 2.3.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IFmJDWpPU3c/U-rLNLQ4cbI/AAAAAAAAUXM/6a0motGrr8U/s1600/MarqueTile.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IFmJDWpPU3c/U-rLNLQ4cbI/AAAAAAAAUXM/6a0motGrr8U/s1600/MarqueTile.png" height="160" width="400" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div>It features a partially completed, total rewrite of version 2. It can now access much more content, including chapter headings and footnotes. Unfortunately, I don't have the time to continue to develop it, so I am leaving it to the open source community if they would like to contribute. I will likely go to it every now and then to make updates and cleanup. I will also look at pull requests, but please don't expect any updates any time soon. This has been a great resource for myself and others, so I hope that it continues to get use. I have been learning a lot about JavaScript and development processes in general as I have been working on this project, but I find the Chrome Extension platform too unstable. The existing code will run somewhat on FireFox. I have not tested it recently, but earlier tries have worked with the help of the PHP file included in the project.<br /><br />Try it out and see more details in the <a href="https://github.com/Duckbrain/lds-scriptures">GitHub project</a>.
