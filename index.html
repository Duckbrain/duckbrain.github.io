                <h4>LDS Scriptures</h4>
                <p>This is an application for downloading and reading scriptures via a Google Chrome Extension. This is no longer under maintainance because I grew tired of the Chrome API's changing and blocking my ways of accessing web resources for security.
                  It does some cool stuff, but is likely broken from repeated refactors. I am currently rewriting this as a new project in Go, called ldss.</p>
